this is the scripts I used to test epto, I used nodocker.sh to run epto peers. and other scripts to take logs of the system.
run-test.rb and nodocker.sh are basically doing the same thing, the only different is that nodocker.sh will add a timestamp to each line of the epto logs.

run nodocker.sh or run-test.rb in this exact folder to work.
